# Battle Ship

## Purpose

The reason this is called "Battle Ship2" is because during my time at Turing School of Software & Design we were tasked with building a battle ship game. It was one of the first projects we did and the one I created with my partner is something I'm proud of, but definitely needs to be "updated" with the skills I've achieved since then.

## Programming decisions

1. I started this project for several reasons, one of which I listed above, I wanted to make an updated version of the game battle ship. Updated from the first iteration I made with my partner during Module 1 during my time at the Turing School of Software & Design. The other reason was because I figured it was time for me to start working on my frontend/styling skills, since I feel pretty confident in my backend skills. 
2. I went with a more retro look, since I really like the retro look and battle ship is a simple game. The styling done on the home page is solely HTML/CSS. The reason for this is because to put JavaScript in a Rails app is a little involved. I plan on using JS on future projects.
